## General Info
A full stack site built for local business owner/operator. The client's previous advertising platform revolved around Instagram. The purpose of this site is to bring the client's advertising strength to a blog where traffic, link-thru's, and affiliate sales can be generated.
Additionally, the client wants the ability to create publicly available educational content that furthers her development as a professional and brings value to her community at large. This site provides her all the means to do so without a heavy CMS.

## Technologies
* Node.js - version 12.18.3
* Express - version 4.17.1
* EJS - version 3.1.5
* HTML5 - CSS3 - ES6

## Integrated API's
* Prismic - Headless Content Management System
* Curator - Social Media Aggregator

## Features
* A headless CMS is used as a blogging engine, autopopulating a main blog page. Individual posts are generated by EJS via the API. 
* A social media aggregator API retrieves the clients latest Instagram content and displays in a custom carousel.
* Secure email auto-responder keeps client email safe, without the need for authentication.

To-do list:
* Improve Open Graph data to be page/post specific.
* Build custom overlay for photo carousel. 
* Institute full server-side rendering and SPA with ejs renderFile() operation.
* Improve font rendering in Chrome.
* Bring site to WCAG 2.0.
* Introduce lazy-loading on Blog Main

## Known Issues:
* Firefox for Android - 1px margin above fixed header allows content to show through when scrolling.
* Current third-party carousel overlay causes a brief double scrollbar display error during it's transition.

## Status
Project is: _in production_
